The only project I've submitted thus far is the final project I completed for my CS 210 class with Dr. Chan.

In it, I was responsible for creating a program responsible for managing a zoo including functions which dictate adding animals among others.

The thing this project did well, far better than those in the past was to interact using all the tools collected throughout the class. 
Those tools include file I/O, language structure, interaction with a second language, and exception handling.
By using all these tools at once, I am able to better utilize this project as a series of notes that will remind me how to do these things in the future.
In addition, I am looking forward to showing my progress in the computer science program at SNHU by posting these projects.

While there are likely many ways I can improve the coding in this project, it is still too fresh in my mind for me to think of new ways. 
If I were to look back at Project 2 for this same class, I can think of an error I mad in the final display calculation in which I used a discrete value instead of a calculated one.
There may be very many errors I missed while progressing through the project that may not be compilation errors but runtime errors instead. 
These errors would result in improper construction of the system much like a faulty beam in a building may not be visible during initial construction.

When writing this code, one of my biggest hurdles was transitioning numbers to strings and vice versa.
In order to overcome this, I looked online on message boards and forums.
Before blindly choosing a function that would get me the result, I made sure to understand what it was doing and how.
If I were to blindly look up a function, I would not have understood exactly why the underlying transition would have worked or how the values may have changed along the way.

The skills learned and applied in this project that may be transferable to other courses include file I/O.
The use of files is one of the most important ones across languages as files store all the information we use on a daily basis, whether online or off.
Files and the attached filetypes are also going to impact the use of computer space as we move forward through the 21st century and the evolution of each language.

Comments are THE most important thing in any code.
They are responsible for providing portability, maintainability and the opportunity for future-proofing any project.
It was using the comments that I was able to adjust a copied java code into the c++ portion I used to construct the project.
It also helped that I understood at least a little of both languages, but without applying the comments I read I would not have been able to transfer the functions so easily.

The most recent file is a software design document I've been working on in my operating systems class. 

As part of the curriculum, I and my classmates examined various parts of the three biggest operating systems in use today: Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.
For this assignment in particular, I must answer a series of questions, six to be precise. 

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

1a. The Gaming room is, to put it simply, a gaming company which currently has a game for android. They would like to see a functional prototype that could be launched on other platforms. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this document?

2a. Once I felt I had all the necessary information, I was able to more accurately define the advantages and weaknesses involved in launching it on the other platforms. After I did this, I was able to define the proper structure for the rest of the system's development. I believe that seeing the feedback from my instructor on previous iterations of the document, I was able to get the feedback I would have gotten from my team were this project more tangible in scope. The feedback proved necessary and seeing the document in action truly illustrated how necessary it is in the development community at large. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

3a. By working through the document and receiving feedback about it from my instructor, a proxy for a  team lead, I was able to see what specific choices had on the overall project and how I needed to change them in order to truly meet the needs of the client. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

4a. As I was going over the document through different iterations, even before my instructor would return the graded version, I was revising the core statement. I kept changing and improving the goals of the software so that it was closer to what the client wanted. If this was a real world client, the ending product on the final iteration of the document would have been closer to what they actually wanted. If I were to revise it more today, the goals of the software would be what I would focus on so that they include the exact words requested by the client and an interpretation of them into a goal to be met by the team. 

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

5a. After the design document was constructed, design of the system was broken up into two separate parts: the client and the server designs. Once each section was made with relevant methods for each necessary task, I was able to test them. Although they did not build at first, feedback from my instructor, or team lead depending on how you look at it, was implemented to modify and improve the construction so it would build, compile, and was testable with the necessary components. After it was tested, we had a working prototype for the client in question. 

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

6a. My initial attempt implemented more features than were necessary or called for. This slowed down development times. I thought about it and considered how the application of system security played a part in the development. Once I did, I came to the conclusion that although security is important, it cannot come at the cost of overall system design. Therefore, the security implemented must be balanced with the client's needs and the level of privacy expected for the information contained therein.

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

1a. To look simply at user needs, we do not truly understand how to prioritize them according to a customer's needs; we may know for our own needs but not for a customer's. 
When we break down those needs into user stories that evaluate how a customer views them, we can prioritize them properly in the product backlog. This is further broken down into the sprint backlog or a kanban board or some other communication system being employed. 

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

2a. After going through the class just a little bit, I thought about my own views on communication and how that played a role in development. The use of daily scrum meetings helps us to keep one another on track even though we may get distracted over time. The level of communication we see throughout the scrum framework allows us to not only stay on track but allow for the inevitable change. Not only that, but the scrum review allows us to show off what we've done so far to the client and any other notable personalities so that they may be the judge regarding needed updates or acceptance.  

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

3a. As I've touched on in many points, communication is the most important thing in a team setting, whether that's software development or a basketball team. What makes someone a good team member in my eyes is the ability to keep everyone up to date with what is happening. By doing this, any changes that need to happen can begin immediately instead of two weeks from now when the sprint is over. That is not to say that sending messages is the only important part of communication. It happens both ways. If said team member cannot receive or act on incoming messages, then those changes cannot effectively happen.

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

1a. DriverPass as a company was interested in improving student drivers' abilities to drive. My team was responsible for creating a website which could handle the finer points of that such as the schedule and the required roles and responsibilities of each person. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

2a. Based on the transcript which was provided, I was able to break down the client's requirements and communicate them to the development team.

3. If you could pick one part of these projects to revise, what would you pick and how would you do it?

3a. The system design document was a little rough when I was completing it. In it, I just stopped and thought about the details surrounding the system that I could think of. In a professional setting, I would hope that I could work with the other members of my team to write a longer list of requirements. They may seem like bad things but they turn the very fluid art of concision into a science that targets what customers are looking for. 

4. How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

4a. One document that I constructed in preparation for the first assignment was a list of customer requirements based on the initial transcript. It ran down the list and covered things based on how they would be related. For example, I've got seven bullets that describe the process of reservations and appointments. Some of those same details made it into the UML class diagram. By rereading the transcript of the interview with the client, I was able to order the list into a set of requirements that guided me throughout the development process. If we do not consider the user's needs when designing, we could very well be wasting our time. 

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

5a. The approach I took in this case was to break down the customer requirements. Once I did that, I was able to create the UML diagrams I could use to verify the customer's requirements and communicate the same to the rest of the team.
