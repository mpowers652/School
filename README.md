The only project I've submitted thus far is the final project I completed for my CS 210 class with Dr. Chan.

In it, I was responsible for creating a program responsible for managing a zoo including functions which dictate adding animals among others.

The thing this project did well, far better than those in the past was to interact using all the tools collected throughout the class. 
Those tools include file I/O, language structure, interaction with a second language, and exception handling.
By using all these tools at once, I am able to better utilize this project as a series of notes that will remind me how to do these things in the future.
In addition, I am looking forward to showing my progress in the computer science program at SNHU by posting these projects.

While there are likely many ways I can improve the coding in this project, it is still too fresh in my mind for me to think of new ways. 
If I were to look back at Project 2 for this same class, I can think of an error I mad in the final display calculation in which I used a discrete value instead of a calculated one.
There may be very many errors I missed while progressing through the project that may not be compilation errors but runtime errors instead. 
These errors would result in improper construction of the system much like a faulty beam in a building may not be visible during initial construction.

When writing this code, one of my biggest hurdles was transitioning numbers to strings and vice versa.
In order to overcome this, I looked online on message boards and forums.
Before blindly choosing a function that would get me the result, I made sure to understand what it was doing and how.
If I were to blindly look up a function, I would not have understood exactly why the underlying transition would have worked or how the values may have changed along the way.

The skills learned and applied in this project that may be transferable to other courses include file I/O.
The use of files is one of the most important ones across languages as files store all the information we use on a daily basis, whether online or off.
Files and the attached filetypes are also going to impact the use of computer space as we move forward through the 21st century and the evolution of each language.

Comments are THE most important thing in any code.
They are responsible for providing portability, maintainability and the opportunity for future-proofing any project.
It was using the comments that I was able to adjust a copied java code into the c++ portion I used to construct the project.
It also helped that I understood at least a little of both languages, but without applying the comments I read I would not have been able to transfer the functions so easily.

# CS 230
The most recent file is a software design document I've been working on in my operating systems class. 

As part of the curriculum, I and my classmates examined various parts of the three biggest operating systems in use today: Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.
For this assignment in particular, I must answer a series of questions, six to be precise. 

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

1a. The Gaming room is, to put it simply, a gaming company which currently has a game for android. They would like to see a functional prototype that could be launched on other platforms. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this document?

2a. Once I felt I had all the necessary information, I was able to more accurately define the advantages and weaknesses involved in launching it on the other platforms. After I did this, I was able to define the proper structure for the rest of the system's development. I believe that seeing the feedback from my instructor on previous iterations of the document, I was able to get the feedback I would have gotten from my team were this project more tangible in scope. The feedback proved necessary and seeing the document in action truly illustrated how necessary it is in the development community at large.
